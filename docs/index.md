# Welcome to Simone

A Python script to repurpose your YouTube videos as blog posts and context-aware screenshots.

## About

> Fun LLM challenge that I'm thinking about: take my 2h13m tokenizer video and translate the video into the format of a book chapter (or a blog post) on tokenization. Something like:

> 1. Whisper the video
> 2. Chop up into segments of aligned images and text
> 3. Prompt engineer an LLM to translate piece by piece
> 4. Export as a page, with links citing parts of original video

> More generally, a workflow like this could be applied to any input video and auto-generate "companion guides" for various tutorials in a more readable, skimmable, searchable format. Feels tractable but non-trivial.
